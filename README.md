Given a string as input, create a program to evaluate whether or not it is a valid IPv4 address. 

A valid IP address should be in the form of: a.b.c.d where a, b, c and d are integer values ranging from 0 to 255 inclusive. 

For example: 

127.0.0.1 - valid 

127.255.255.255 - valid 

257.0.0.1 - invalid 

255a.0.0.1 - invalid 

127.0.0.0.1 - invalid
